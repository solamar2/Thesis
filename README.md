Electroencephalogram (EEG) data-based analysis of paroxysmal slow wave events patterns in brain pathologies

Abstract :
Slowing of brain activity observed in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings is normal under resting conditions such as sleep. However, in a series of studies recently described a new pattern of cortical slowing in patients with epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease [1], [2]  composed of transient paroxysmal slowing of the network (PSWE). These events were defined with median power frequency (MPF) less than 6 [Hz] and duration longer than 5 [sec]. In this research, we plan to use existing EEG data, collected from subjects with brain pathologies such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, bipolar depression, and test if the pattern of PSWEs is similar in both groups or disease-dependent. Specifically we will study for each group the spatial and temporal characteristics of PSWEs, including shape of the signal morphology, dynamic changes with time, frequency and space.
